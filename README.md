# Polaris Linux Handbook

Welcome to the Polaris Linux Handbook. This guide will explain what is Polaris and whats its future plans

## What is Polaris Linux

Polaris Linux is an Arch-based distribution designed to be minimal, customizable, and built entirely from scratch, much like a traditional Arch installation. You retain full control over your system while benefiting from our curated tools and structure.

## Project Goal

Polaris Linux started as a continuation of a project abandoned by its original creator. I have taken over development with the aim of making it stable for everyday use, optimized for gaming performance, and ready for development and coding workflows. It is also being designed to work well on older computers and legacy Mac hardware, with plans to include open source Mac drivers when possible.

## Current Status

This is an early and unstable build, so expect issues. Tested results so far:

* Booting works in some cases, but the system may not always appear in the BIOS boot menu (rare issue)
* Frequent coding errors due to instability in the current build
* No graphical user interface is included yet; the system is TTY-based only

## Who is this for

Polaris Linux is suited for users who prefer building their system from scratch, those who want full control over their operating system, and gamers or developers looking for a clean Arch base with extra polish. It is also a good choice for users with older computers or Macs who want a modern yet lightweight system.

## How to Install

The installation process is similar to Arch Linux, with a few Polaris-specific steps. You will need to:

1. Boot into the Polaris installer ISO
2. Follow the guided or manual installation process
3. Configure your system to your preferences
